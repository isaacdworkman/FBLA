Elkhorn High School FBLA's Coding and Programming project
By:Matt Uehling, Ben Kubichek and Isaac Workmen

The goal of this program is to basically create a travel website with atleast 50 different locations and 5 different attributes for the locations.The program consists of 4 different classes. 
First the main class which calls upon other classes as needs. The premise of the class is to interact mostly with the user. Asking the user a series of questions about which traits they desire for their location. Then after each trait is decided on, the user is asked if they would want to change any particular trait. Then it calls the print method in the Attraction class and the program is finished. 
Secondly the comparing class, the class has two main purposes to tell whether or not the user entry is acceptable and removes locations for the attraction class. The Comparing class accomplishes the user entry justification by simple if statements to predetermined acceptable traits.
Thirdly is the Attraction class. This classes main purpose is 2D array containing all the locations and the attributes. Along with storing the users desired traits and printing out various things. Including the best location for the users desired traits, the traits of various locations and printing out the users desired traits.
Finally is the help page. The help page is simply a introductory statement, a scanner and some if statements. The user enters which question they would prefer to have answered then the program answers it and sends them back to the main page.
