This is Elkhorn FBLA's Coding and Programming Project.

Our program is centered around a 2d array containing all of our locations and their attributes.

The java code can be ran on a console and will go through each attribute step by step allowing the user to choose their desired preference for each attribute (if they have one). It will then either return a list of locations that match the user's preferences or tell them to try again if there is no location that matches all of their preferences.

This project was created by Matt Uehling, Ben Kubicek, and Isaac Workman. 

The prompt for the project is below.

You have been hired by your state or local areaâ€™s tourism bureau to develop a program that suggests attractions (can be tourist attractions, restaurants, shopping, things to do, etc.) to potential visitors. Your program will allow users to search for attractions in the area based on desired attributes, such as location, type of attraction, and amenities. Your program must include at least 50 attractions, and users must be able to define at least five desired attributes to search for an attraction.
